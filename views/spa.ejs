            <h3>ELECTRONIC MUSCLE TONING</h3>
            <h5>30 minute sessions</h5>
            <p>Remember the days of saying "I wish there was a machine that could get me into shape!"? Well... Electronic Muscle Toning is a computer enhanced system designed to aid weight loss and / or reduce body measurements by tightening and toning muscles. The Electronic Muscle Toning delivers a gentle impluse of the muscle via a soft rubber pad. Your muscles respond to this impulse by contracting and relaxing in a rhythmic way, just as they would during a tummy crunch or sit-up exercise. Generally two 45-minute sessions twice a week will yield optimum results in a matter of weeks. With consistent Electronic Muscle Toning you will:

                Lose inches
                Tighten and tone muscles and skin
                Reduce cellulite
                Increase circulation</p>

The machine offers 30-60 second bursts of vibrations at a time for maximum muscle response. Just another way we are shaking up the spa industry.</p>

            <h5>10-20 minute sessions</h5>
            <p>Tanning's about far more than serving aesthethic purposes. It promotes the intake of Vitamin D and most of us could admit that we're not out in the sun as much as we could be. With our sunshowers and lying down sunbeds, it's like having a remote for the sun.</p>
